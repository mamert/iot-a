# iot-a
Junk, mostly.

Group 1 of iot stuff.
Initial idea:
* 1 clock: arduino, connected esp8266 (no idea which one), leds, thermometer, some kinda input. Server allowing setup of alarms and thermostat.
* 1 relay node - 2x power, 2+ USB power ports, thermometer.
* 1 breadboard on battery. Initially: thermometer?

TODO:
* WiFi, to set time via SNTP or somesuch
* WiFi setup GUI
